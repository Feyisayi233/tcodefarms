# Public Assets

Place your logo file here as `logo.png` or `logo.svg`.

The logo should be:
- PNG or SVG format
- Transparent background (recommended)
- High resolution (at least 200x200px for best quality)
- Named exactly: `logo.png` or `logo.svg`

The logo will automatically appear in:
- Navigation bar (top left)
- Footer (top left section)

If you have a different filename, update the image paths in:
- `components/navigation.tsx`
- `components/footer.tsx`
